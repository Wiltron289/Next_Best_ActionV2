# NBA Queue Widget - Executive Summary

## üéØ **Purpose**
The NBA (Next Best Action) Queue Widget is an intelligent task management tool that automatically prioritizes and assigns sales activities to the right sales representatives at the right time, ensuring optimal follow-up on high-value opportunities.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **1. Intelligent Queue Generation**
- **AI-Powered Scoring**: Each account/opportunity receives a priority score (0-100) based on:
  - Account characteristics (employee count, company age, payroll status)
  - Opportunity stage and value
  - Recent activity patterns
  - Web usage and engagement signals

### **2. Smart Assignment & Display**
- **Automatic Assignment**: Queue items are automatically assigned to the appropriate sales rep based on account ownership
- **Real-Time Updates**: 30-second auto-refresh ensures reps see the most current priorities
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically skips accounts that don't meet engagement criteria (e.g., closed opportunities, recent calls)

### **3. Intelligent Action Execution**
- **Smart Navigation**: When accepting an action, reps are taken to the most relevant record:
  - **Opportunity** (if one exists) ‚Üí **Account** (fallback)
- **Smart Contact Logic**: Automatically selects the right contact number based on opportunity stage:
  - **New/Attempted stages** ‚Üí Use NBA Queue contact
  - **Other stages** ‚Üí Use Opportunity primary contact
- **Action Types Supported**:
  - üìû **Calls** (with click-to-dial integration)
  - üìß **Emails** (with pre-filled templates)
  - üìÖ **Meetings** (with calendar integration)
  - üñ•Ô∏è **Demos** (product demonstrations)
  - üìã **Proposals** (opportunity creation)
  - üìù **Follow-ups** (task creation)

### **4. Call Disposition Tracking**
- **Automatic Task Creation**: Every accepted action creates a task for tracking
- **Call Outcome Recording**: Reps can log call results (connected, voicemail, not interested, etc.)
- **Activity History**: All interactions are automatically logged for future reference

## üí° **Key Benefits**
