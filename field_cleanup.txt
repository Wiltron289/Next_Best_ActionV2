FIELDS YOU CAN LIKELY DELETE:
=============================

Based on the code analysis, these fields appear UNUSED and can probably be deleted:

- Action_Context__c
- Company_Age_Days__c (duplicate of Account__r.Company_Age_in_Days__c)
- Active_Employees__c (duplicate of Account__r.Employee_Count__c)
- Feature_Usage__c
- Contact_Name__c
- Contact_Phone__c
- Current_Payroll_Provider__c (duplicate of Opportunity__r.Account_Current_Payroll__c)
- Last_Call_Date__c (duplicate of Opportunity__r.Last_Call_Date_Time__c)
- Opportunity_Stage__c (duplicate of Opportunity__r.StageName)
- Opportunity_Source__c (duplicate of Opportunity__r.Source__c)
- Payroll_Buyer_Stage__c (duplicate of Opportunity__r.Payroll_Buyer_Stage__c)
- Rep_Notes__c
- Close_Date__c
- Inception_Switcher__c

IMPORTANT NOTES:
===============

Before deleting any fields, double-check if they are used in:
1. Workflows/Processes
2. Validation Rules
3. Other Apex classes not in this project
4. Reports/Dashboards
5. External integrations

The duplicates (like Company_Age_Days__c vs Account__r.Company_Age_in_Days__c) are definitely safe to delete since the code uses the relationship fields.

RECOMMENDED CLEANUP ORDER:
=========================
1. Delete duplicate fields first (safest)
2. Delete unused fields that don't appear in any other metadata
3. Test thoroughly after each deletion
4. Keep backup of field metadata before deletion
