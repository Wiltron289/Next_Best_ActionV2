Next Best Action (NBA) App — Guide for Sales Reps

WHAT IT IS
- The NBA app surfaces the best next account/opportunity to work on, explains why, and lets you take action quickly (call, update stage/next steps, or snooze/dismiss). It refreshes as you work so you always see the most relevant item.

THE SCREEN
- Two panels:
  - Left: Action Widget (what to do now + Accept/Dismiss)
  - Right: Record Details (key Opportunity info, grouped sections)
- You can resize the columns. Each panel scrolls internally so buttons never get cut off.

HOW ITEMS ARE CHOSEN (PRIORITY + MULTIPLIERS)
- Items are ordered by a priority score, adjusted by recent signals:
  - Web activity in last hour: 1.25x
  - “Best time to call” within ±30 minutes of now: 1.2x
  - Recent progression on the account:
    - Within 7 days: 1.5x
    - Within 30 days: 1.2x
- What you’ll see:
  - The adjusted score drives which item you get next.
  - A note about applied multipliers is saved on the action (Priority_Multiplier_Applied__c).

WHEN AN ITEM WILL NOT BE SERVED (EXCEPTION CRITERIA)
- The app will skip an item if:
  - The related Opportunity is in a closed state:
    - Closed Won - Pending Implementation
    - Closed Won
    - Closed Lost
    - Ran Payroll
  - The Opportunity had a call already today (Last_Call_Date_Time__c is today)
  - There’s a future follow-up date in the future (Future_Follow_Up_Date__c > today)
  - There’s a scheduled Event (meeting/call) more than 15 minutes from now
    - The item becomes eligible again 15 minutes before the meeting starts, or any time after it ends
  - The Account’s payroll status is mid-process (Pending, Processing, Paid)
  - The item is snoozed (see Snooze below) and its snooze time hasn’t passed yet

ACCEPTING AN ACTION (FOR CALLS)
- What happens when you click Accept:
  - A completed Task is created for tracking.
  - The dialer launches with the best number available (see “How we choose the phone number” below).
  - The Call Disposition form opens.
    - Fields and order:
      - Phone Number Called
      - Call Disposition
      - Opportunity Stage Update
      - Call Notes
      - Next Step Date
      - Next Step
    - Stage Update defaults to the Opportunity’s current stage.
    - If you choose “Connected - DM,” you must provide Next Step Date and Next Step, unless the stage you select is a closed state (Closed Won / Closed Lost / Closed Won - Pending Implementation).
  - If you select “Closed Won - Pending Implementation,” the Project Initiation Wizard flow opens for that Opportunity.

- What gets written back when you complete the disposition:
  - To the NBA record:
    - Status becomes Accepted
    - Multiplier notes saved to Priority_Multiplier_Applied__c
    - Next step fields (Next_Step_Date__c, Next_Steps__c) if provided
  - To the Opportunity (if related):
    - StageName updates if you chose a stage
    - Next Step Date (Next_Step_Date__c) and Next Step (NextStep) if provided
    - Call Notes are added to the TOP of Description with a timestamp (newest at the top)

- When the dial starts:
  - Opportunity.Last_Call_Date_Time__c is set to now
  - If Opportunity.First_Call_Date_Time__c is blank, it’s set to now (only once)

DISMISSING OR SNOOZING AN ACTION
- Open Dismiss and choose one:
  - Call Scheduled
    - You pick the date/time of the scheduled call
    - The item is paused until 15 minutes before that time
    - Status becomes Snoozed, Snoozed_Until__c is set
  - Time Zone
    - You choose how many hours to delay
    - The item won’t surface until that time passes
  - Other
    - Enter a reason, and the item is dismissed immediately
- The Dismiss/Snooze panel scrolls internally; buttons remain visible.

HOW WE CHOOSE THE PHONE NUMBER
- If the NBA item has an Opportunity:
  - If the stage is “New Opportunity” or “Attempted,” and there’s a “Best Person to Call,” we use the Best Number to Call; otherwise we use the Opportunity’s Primary Contact phone.
  - For all other stages, we use the Opportunity’s Primary Contact phone.
- If there is no Opportunity:
  - If “Best Person to Call” is set, we use that number; else we use the Account’s Primary Contact phone (or Account phone as final fallback).

RECORD DETAILS (RIGHT PANEL)
- Three collapsible sections with purple headers (you can expand/collapse):
  - Opportunity Details
    - Name, Stage, Close Date, Primary Contact, Account Business Category, Account Admin Links, Current Payroll, Description
  - Payroll Details
    - Payroll Buyer Stage, Payroll Risk Level, Fed Auth Finish, Bank Connect Finish, Pay Sched Finish, Last Progression Time, Account Blocked Reason
  - Next Step and Future Follow Up Details
    - Next Step Date, Next Step, Future Follow-Up Date, Future Follow-Up Reason
- Inline edits are allowed. Changes here update the record immediately.

STATUSES YOU’LL SEE
- Pending: eligible to be served next
- In Progress: you accepted and are working it (always allowed to complete)
- Snoozed: paused until Snoozed_Until__c
- Accepted: disposition saved or email sent (completed)
- Dismissed: removed with a reason

REFRESH BEHAVIOR
- The app auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.
- Use the refresh button on the widget whenever you want instant updates.

PERMISSIONS
- You’ll be assigned the NBA_Queue_User permission set to ensure access to the required fields and features.

IF SOMETHING DOESN’T LOOK RIGHT
- Try a hard refresh of your browser tab.
- If an item is appearing when you know a future meeting exists, check the meeting’s Start time—items are blocked only until 15 minutes before the meeting.

SUMMARY
- Items are prioritized with multipliers for recency signals and best call window.
- Items are skipped for closed stages, today’s prior call, future follow-ups, future events, payroll processing, and snooze windows.
- Accept logs a completed Task, launches the dialer, and updates Opportunity/NBA; “Closed Won - Pending Implementation” launches the setup flow.
- Dismiss supports Snooze (scheduled or time-zone) and “Other” with a reason.
- Record Details are grouped, collapsible, and inline-editable.
